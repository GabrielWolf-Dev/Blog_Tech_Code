 ## About:
 A static blog developed only Front-End and consuming the json posts.
 This blog promotes the user to gain new knowledge about the world of programming.

## Some proposed challenges:
The blog must have only Front-End technologies(Without Frameworks Js), hosting in the GitHub pages and consume datas posts without a Back-End.
For simulated good, I kept the json inside the "api" file, where from the file location URL, I can consume this json with fetch API.
In addition to building all the logic to generate posts, show recent posts via Js.

## Technologies and Tools(Design):
* HTML5;
* SASS;
* JavaScript;
* Figma;
  * Briefing;
  * Adobe Color(Choose a color palette);

## My challenges:
- [x] HTML5 semantics;
- [x] Design Responsive;
- [x] Style with SASS;
- [x] Logic last posts;
- [x] Select and filter posts with respect categories;
- [x] Some functions, for example the Menu mobile, Smooth scroll, etc...

## Future implementations:
* Make more accessible adding WAI-ARIA in some functions and elements of blog;
* Insert more posts before publishing the project
